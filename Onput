BREAKING THE STATUE

i have always known

i just didn't understand
the inner conflictions
arresting our hands
gravitating close enough
expansive distamce between
i couldn't give you more
but i meant everything
when the day comes

you find your heart

wants something more
than a viece and a part

your life will change
like astatue set free

to walk among us

to created estiny

we didn't break anv rules

we didn't make mistakes
making beauty in loving

making lovine for days
